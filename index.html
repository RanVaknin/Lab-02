            <h2>Where am I from?</h2>
            <p>I was born in Queens, NY in 1992 to Dominican Parents I lived in New York until I was 10 and then we moved to the Dominican Republic where I actually got to learn about computers and learned how to use them and also I started experimenting with HTML and that time.
            </p>
            <p> At age 16 I left Dominican Republic and came back to New York to finish my education and after graduating High School I joined the Navy as an Aviation Ordnanceman in which I served for 5 years and then I got out in 2018.</p>
            <h2>What are my hobbies?</h2>
            <p>I love making music and singing it has been one of my passions along with Computers although I probably dedicated more time to music in the past than Coding which is why I am now taking a break from music to actually develop my coding skills</p>
